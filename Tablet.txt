It is a strange Tablet, nothing you've ever seen before. There are ports on it that you do not recognize. It is very slim and currently locked. It does have a working flashlight though.

Jeff
You plug the tablet into the door, it pops up with a similar menu as before, you press a button on the menu just like Jeff did before
